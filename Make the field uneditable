During create or edit a record, sometimes we want to make a certain field un-editable
this can be achieved in the Interface BDEF, by flagin that certain field as readonly.

Sample below will make field "ReqID" readonly....pls. be noted the comment !!!

managed implementation in class ZCL_TJ_REQUEST2 unique;
strict ( 2 );
with draft;

define behavior for ZTJ_I_REQUEST2 alias Request
persistent table ztj_request
draft table ZTJ_REQ_DRAFT2
lock master total etag Chgdt
authorization master( global )

{
  field ( readonly )
   UUID,                     
// ReqID,       <= if we put it here, it wont work !!!!!
   Crtdt,       <= this fields must also be exist in consumption view
   Crtby,
   Chgdt,
   Chgby;

  field ( numbering : managed )
   UUID;

  field ( readonly )
    ReqID;          // <= this has to be separated from other read only fields !!!!

// we can also set the field, mandatory during create, but readonly during edit, this is so cool
  //field ( mandatory: create, readonly: update )
  //  ReqID;


  create;
  update;
  delete;

  //** optional determination to determine the reqid
  determination CreateKeys on modify { create; }

  draft action Edit;
  draft action Activate;
  draft action Discard;
  draft action Resume;
  draft determine action Prepare;

  mapping for ZTJ_REQUEST
  {
    UUID = UUID;
    PrjID = PRJID;
    SprID = SPRID;
    ReqID = REQID;
    Reqds = REQDS;
    Reqor = REQOR;
    Reqdt = REQDT;
    ResID = RESID;
    Reqcd = REQCD;
    Plstdt = PLSTDT;
    Plfndt = PLFNDT;
    Acstdt = ACSTDT;
    Acfndt = ACFNDT;
    StaID = STAID;
    Crtby = CRTBY;
    Crtdt = CRTDT;
    Crttm = CRTTM;
    Crtst = CRTST;
    Chgby = CHGBY;
    Chgdt = CHGDT;
    Chgtm = CHGTM;
    Chgst = CHGST;
  }
}
