First, in the source data cds view, we need to use this annotation  @ObjectModel.text.element: [<field_name_of_the_txt>], example
@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: [#NONE]
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'Value help for Request Status'
@Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations: true
@ObjectModel.usageType:{
    serviceQuality: #X,
    sizeCategory: #S,
    dataClass: #MIXED
}
define view entity ZTJ_VH_REQSTAT
  as select from ztj_reqstat_txt
{
      @ObjectModel.text.element: ['Stads']
  key staid as StaID,
      //@Semantics.language: true
  key spras as Spras,
      //@Semantics.text: true
      stads as Stads
}
where
  spras = 'E'

2nd, in the "Interface CDS view", we need to associate the main entity to the txt cds view like 
define root view entity ZTJ_DM_REQUEST
  as select from ztj_request as Request
    association [1..*] to ZTJ_VH_REQSTAT as _Stat on $projection.StaID = _Stat.StaID

complete code as below:
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: '##GENERATED Request RAP Generated'
define root view entity ZTJ_DM_REQUEST
  as select from ztj_request as Request
    association [1..*] to ZTJ_VH_REQSTAT as _Stat on $projection.StaID = _Stat.StaID
{
  key reqid as ReqID,
  key prjid as PrjID,
  key sprid as SprID,
  reqds as Reqds,
  reqor as Reqor,
  reqdt as Reqdt,
  resid as ResID,
  reqcd as Reqcd,
  plstdt as Plstdt,
  plfndt as Plfndt,
  acstdt as Acstdt,
  acfndt as Acfndt,
  @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{entity: { name: 'ZTJ_VH_REQSTAT', 
                                                      element: 'StaID'  }}]  
  //@ObjectModel.text.association: '_Stat'  
  staid as StaID,
  @Semantics.user.createdBy: true
  crtby as Crtby,
  @Semantics.systemDate.createdAt: true
  crtdt as Crtdt,
  @Semantics.systemTime.createdAt: true
  crttm as Crttm,
  @Semantics.systemDateTime.createdAt: true
  crtst as Crtst,
  @Semantics.user.lastChangedBy: true
  chgby as Chgby,
  @Semantics.systemDate.createdAt: true
  chgdt as Chgdt,
  @Semantics.systemTime.createdAt: true
  chgtm as Chgtm,
  @Semantics.systemDateTime.lastChangedAt: true
  chgst as Chgst,
  
  _Stat
  
}
