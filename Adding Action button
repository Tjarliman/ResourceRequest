Action button is a custom button that we can place along with the Create / Delete button
to activate it

1. in the Interface BDEF, add this statement : action startDevelop result [1] $self; 
This statement means, add method startDevelop to handle the click button event and the results of this action will affect only 1 records at a time (depends on how we build the logic).

2. inside the bdef class, we need to add this method, by implementing this statements:
# at the implementation part
  METHOD startDevelop.
    " Modify in local mode: BO-related updates that are not relevant for authorization checks
    MODIFY ENTITIES OF ztj_i_request2 IN LOCAL MODE
           ENTITY Request
              UPDATE FIELDS ( Acstdt )
                 WITH VALUE #( FOR key IN keys ( %tky      = key-%tky
                                                 Acstdt = sy-datum ) ). " Accepted

    " Read changed data for action result
    READ ENTITIES OF ztj_i_request2 IN LOCAL MODE
      ENTITY Request
         ALL FIELDS WITH
         CORRESPONDING #( keys )
       RESULT DATA(requests).

    result = VALUE #( FOR request IN requests ( %tky      = request-%tky
                                              %param    = request ) ).

  ENDMETHOD.

# at the definition part
    METHODS startDevelop FOR MODIFY
      IMPORTING keys FOR ACTION Request~startDevelop RESULT result. "Request.

3. inside metadata extension of our projection view, put this statement along with one of the @UI.lineItem annotation, like :
@UI.lineItem: [ {
    position: 110 ,
    importance: #MEDIUM
  },
  
  { type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'startDevelop', label: 'Start', position: 5 }, => can be placed at any @UI.lineItem
  { type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'finishDevelop', label: 'Finish', position: 6 } ]
  @UI.identification: [ 
  { position: 110  } ]
  Acstdt;

Note: 
1. using @UI.lineItem annotation will make the button appear together with Create/Delete button
2. using @UI.Identification annotation will make the button appear at the object page together with Edit/Delete button
